MOMENTUM DEMO (2 min) - Backboard Integration Showcase
======================================================

BACKBOARD APIs WE'RE USING:
---------------------------
- Assistants API: Creates "Momentum Assistant" with custom system prompt
- Memory API: Stores decisions, facts, risks with semantic search
- Threads API: Creates conversation contexts for task execution
- Messages API: Sends prompts, receives AI-generated responses

OPENCLAW INTEGRATION:
- Local agent execution: openclaw agent --local --thinking medium
- Falls back to Backboard Messages API when local unavailable


STEP 1: MEMORY GRAPH (20 sec)
-----------------------------
"This is Backboard's Memory API visualized. Each node is stored via
POST /assistants/{id}/memory with metadata for semantic retrieval."

> Show nodes, mention they're queryable by the AI


STEP 2: GENERATE REPORT (30 sec)
--------------------------------
"Report generation uses Backboard's Messages API - we create a thread,
send project context, and get structured analysis back."

> Generate report, save PDF to memory
> "This PDF is now stored in Backboard Memory for future reference"


STEP 3: EMAIL REPORT (30 sec)
-----------------------------
"Attaching memory references - these are retrieved via Backboard's
semantic search before sending to the agent."

> Attach 1 memory, send via Himalaya


STEP 4: CREATE TASK WITH CONTEXT (30 sec)
-----------------------------------------
"Creating a task with Backboard memory references. When executed,
OpenClaw pulls this context via the Memory API."

> Create task, attach decision + report PDF, save (don't run)


CLOSING (10 sec)
----------------
"Momentum + Backboard = persistent AI memory that grows smarter
with every interaction."
